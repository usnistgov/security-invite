    "### User Input Potential Dangers \n",
    "- #### User input can contain unexpected characters and symbols\n",
    "- #### Users can provide input shorter or longer than the length you expected\n",
    "- #### Users can deduce semantics or URL parameters POST requests and replay or manipulate all of them\n",
    "- #### Users can and will intentionally attack applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### In safe implementations: \n",
    "- #### **User Input ALWAYS** has to be constrained in length, unless specified otherwise \n",
    "- #### **User Input ALWAYS** has to be sanitized with RegEx or code logic\n",
    "- #### Any sanitation faults must be logged \n",
    "- #### Any file reading must be wrapped in exception handling blocks at all tiers of the application depth from the Front-End to the Back-End. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### On the front end, RegEx and Input Limiting/Masking are the most common sanitation methods of user input. Use session management and URL parameter protection methods to prevent web-requests replay and URL parameters manipulation. On the back-end, the use of Parametrized and Type-Locked Database queries and stored procedures help realize the defense-in-depth concept.  "
